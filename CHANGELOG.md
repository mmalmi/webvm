# Changelog

## 2.0.1 - 2026-07-16

- Vendor the immutable FIPS TypeScript 0.0.26 core, Ethernet, and WebRTC
  release assets with fail-closed SHA-256 and SHA-512 verification.
- Preserve the guest identity across reloads and reject stale handshake epochs
  without changing the native FIPS or `nostr.pubsub/1` wire contracts.
- Keep WebVM's Nostr service on the shared authenticated pubsub transport.
